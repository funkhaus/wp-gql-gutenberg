## What is WpGraphQL Gutenberg

**wp-graphql-gutenberg** is a wordpress plugin which extends [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) schema with new fields and types, so you are able to query content as structured data for any post which uses block editor.

- supports revisions
- supports advanced block editor features like reusable blocks, attributes deprecations and dynamic (server side rendered) blocks
- enables live previews as you make edits (no need to hit the preview button)
